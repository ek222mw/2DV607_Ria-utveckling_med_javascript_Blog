I think that this course have helped me improve my skills in programming in many ways. I think that everything worked good. I think my effort was good, i realy had to put in some extra work to learn RIA, i thought that it was difficult to understand in the beginning. So much new stuff to learn.I was pleased with that when i got started that i was able to improve all the way and to finally finish the project in a nice way. I have learned to use React, Redux, Firebase database and also an external library lodash where i also did my deep dive into. I definitely got the takeaways i was hoping for from the start.//Emil
